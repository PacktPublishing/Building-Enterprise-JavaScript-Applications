In 1995, Brendan started working for Netscape, where he originally intended to develop a browser that uses the Scheme language. However, Brendan's superiors wanted to use a language that is more similar to Java. The end result is a new language - JavaScript - which carries much of the functionality of Scheme, but the syntax of Java. Then, in 1998, Brendan co-founded the Mozilla project that is intended to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape browser. Currently, Brendan is the CEO of Brave, an Internet security company which developed the Brave web browser."
