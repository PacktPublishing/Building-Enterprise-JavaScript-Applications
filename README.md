# Building Enterprise JavaScript Applications (BEJA)

Building Enterprise JavaScript Applications, published by Packt

<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-enterprise-javascript-applications"><img src="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/cover%20-%20Copy_8514.png" alt="Book Name" height="256px" align="right"></a>

This is the official code repository for [Building Enterprise JavaScript Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-enterprise-javascript-applications), published by Packt.

* Chapters 1-3 outlines pre-requisite information and contains no code at all.
* In chapters 4-13, we build our backend API from scratch. It's recommended that you use download the [`d4nyll/hobnob`](https://github.com/d4nyll/hobnob) repository and follow along. The starting and finishing point of each chapter can be found as [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/d4nyll/hobnob/releases) page of the repository.
* In chapters 14-16, we build a very simple frontend client from scratch. The instructions should be easy to follow, but you can find the end product under [`Chapter17/hobnob-client`](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Enterprise-JavaScript-Applications/tree/master/Chapter17/hobnob-client).
* In chapters 17-18, we deploy our application using Docker and Kubernetes. The end product of these two chapters can be found under [`Chapter17/hobnob-deploy`](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Enterprise-JavaScript-Applications/tree/master/Chapter17/hobnob-deploy)

**Learn to build and deploy robust JavaScript applications using Cucumber, Mocha, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
With the over-abundance of tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, it's easy to feel lost. Build tools, package managers, loaders, bundlers, linters, compilers, transpilers, typecheckers - how do you make sense of it all?

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) throughout the entire book
* Use Cucumber, Mocha and Selenium to write E2E, integration, unit and UI tests
* Build stateless APIs using Express and Elasticsearch
* Document your API using OpenAPI and Swagger
* Build and bundle front-end applications using React, Redux and Webpack
