This is the code repository for [Building Enterprise JavaScript Applications](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/building-enterprise-javascript-applications), published by Packt.

**Learn to build and deploy robust JavaScript applications using Cucumber, Mocha, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
With the over-abundance of tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, it's easy to feel lost. Build tools, package managers, loaders, bundlers, linters, compilers, transpilers, typecheckers - how do you make sense of it all?

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) throughout the entire book
* Use Cucumber, Mocha and Selenium to write E2E, integration, unit and UI tests
* Build stateless APIs using Express and Elasticsearch
* Document your API using OpenAPI and Swagger
* Build and bundle front-end applications using React, Redux and Webpack
